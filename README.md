# Statistical Learning

The project focuses on analyzing data from the winequality-white.csv dataset to predict the quality of white wine using statistical and machine learning models. The objectives include:

1. Classification Task: Predicting wine quality as bad, average, or good, based on defined score thresholds.
   
2. Regression Task: Predicting the exact quality score without categorization.
  
3. Anomaly Detection: Identifying and addressing potential outliers in the dataset.
   
4. Feature Importance: Evaluating which features have the most significant influence on wine quality, as determined by the models.
   
The project aims to provide insights into the factors affecting wine quality while building robust predictive models for classification and regression tasks.

Beyond this, the repository also includes implementations of various statistical learning models applied to other datasets, demonstrating key methods and approaches.
